This project analyzes vehicle performance using the mtcars dataset in R.

# Correlation Analysis and ggplot2 Visualization in R

## Project Overview
This project explores correlation analysis using R's statistical functions and visualization tools. I analyze the classic **mtcars** dataset to calculate correlations between variables like horsepower (hp), miles per gallon (mpg), and vehicle weight (wt). Additionally, I use `ggplot2` to create scatter plots showing relationships between these variables.

## Contents
- Correlation matrix calculation
- Visualization with heatmaps and scatter plots
- Statistical analysis of vehicle attributes

## Key Findings
- Strong negative correlation (-0.78) between horsepower and fuel efficiency
- Heavier cars tend to have lower fuel efficiency (correlation -0.86)
- Visual confirmation of relationships using ggplot2 scatter plots
